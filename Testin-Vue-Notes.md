# Testing Approaches

### Manual Testing
  - serves dual purpose : 'Does it work?' and 'Does it work well?'

- Goal is to gurantee the application works under real-world circumstances.

  ### Four types of Automated Tests

  1. E2E System Tests   - Entire System including Infrastructure without Mocking
  2. Application Tests  - User Interface and Business logic 
  3. Component Tests    - Vue components within application
  4. Unit Tests         - Piece of Code
